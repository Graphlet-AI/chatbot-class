    "# What is LangChain?\n",
    "\n",
    "[LangChain](https://langchain.com/) is a popular chatbot and LLM library that efficiently connects many tools. It is known as an easy way to produce chatbots, but is actually much more: an **onramp** to generative AI. LangChain is like [Ruby on Rails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails) [which powered Web 2.0] for generative artificial intelligence. It has enabled the rapid adoption of LLM technology across the web, startup ecosystem and in the modern enterprise [big companies!].\n",

    "\n",
    "Lang stands for language, which is the primary focus of LangChain, and chain — the connotation of connecting things — refers to the chain component used in LangChain. Chains are sequences of instructions that the framework executes to perform a task. This simplifies the use of Large Language Models for specific tasks and enables you to combine the power of LLMs (Large Language Models) with other programming techniques.\n",

    "## Basic components of LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "There are six basic components of Langchain:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Models\n",
    "- Prompts\n",
    "- Chains\n",
    "- Memory\n",
    "- Indexes\n",
    "- Agents and Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s briefly talk about these components.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "<center><img src=\"../images/6-langchain-components.webp\" width=\"600px\" /></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Models in LangChain are large language models (LLMs) trained on enormous amounts of massive datasets of text and code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Models are used in LangChain to generate text, answer questions, translate languages, and much more. They are also used to store information that the framework can access later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: GPT-x, Bloom, Flan T5, Alpaca, LLama, Dolly, FastChat-T5, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "<center><img src=\"../images/langchain-models.webp\" width=\"600px\" /></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompts are pieces of text that guide the LLM to generate the desired output. Prompts can be simple or complex and can be used for text generation, translating languages, answering questions, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "In LangChain, prompts play a vital role in controlling the output of the LLM. You can influence the LLM to generate the desired output by carefully crafting the prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of how prompts can be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Specify the desired output format: You can, for example, use a prompt to instruct the LLM to generate text, translate languages, or answer questions. Example: Translate the input to Arabic\n",
    "* Provide context: A prompt can provide context for the LLM, such as information about the output topic or examples of the desired output. Example: Explain the answer step-by-step like a school teacher\n",
    "* Constrain the output: You can use a prompt to limit the LLM’s output by specifying a maximum length or selecting a list of keywords to include in the output. Example: Generate a tweet post using less than 140 words\n",
    "\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "<center><img src=\"../images/langchain-prompts.webp\" width=\"600px\" /></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indexes\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexes are unique data structures to store information about the data content. This information can include terms found in each document, document location in the dataset, relationships between documents, etc. Vectorstores are data structures storing vector representations of a dataset’s terms. A retriever is an interface that returns documents in response to an unstructured query. It is broader in scope than a vector store.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"../images/langchain-indexes.webp\" width=\"600px\" /></center>\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding indexes, vectorstores, and retrievers is key to building an app on your specific data. Consider another example of a chain that includes all three components:\n",
    "\n",
    "A chain is formed to answer financial questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The chain uses an index to find all documents that contain the word “finance.”\n",
    "* The chain uses a vectorstore to find other terms that are most similar to the word “finance” (“money,” “investments,” etc.).\n",
    "* The chain uses a retriever to retrieve the documents that are ranked highest for the query “What are ways to invest?”.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory in LangChain is a method of storing data that the LLM can later access. This information can include previous chain results, the context of the current chain, and any other information that the LLM requires. It also enables the application to keep track of the current conversation’s context.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"../images/langchain-memory.webp\" width=\"600px\" /></center>\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory plays a vital role in LangChain, allowing the LLM to learn from previous interactions and build up a knowledge base. This knowledge base can then be used to improve the performance of future chains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the creation of a chain designed to answer real estate-related questions. The chain may use memory to store the results of previous chains that have responded to real estate questions. When the chain asked a new question about a similar topic, this information could be used to improve its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chains\n",
    "\n",
    "Chains are sequences of instructions the LangChain framework executes to perform a task. Chains may connect other LangChain components based on the application requirements. They allow the framework to perform a wide variety of tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"../images/langchain-chains.webp\" width=\"600px\" /></center>\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume we’re creating an app to assist us in interview preparation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Prompt: “I’m getting ready for an interview for a position as a software engineer. Can you ask me some common interview questions that I may expect?”\n",
    "* Function A: This function would access the LLM’s knowledge of the software engineering field, such as its knowledge of common interview questions for software engineers. It can also look for appropriate data in the vectorstore.\n",
    "* Function B: This function would manipulate data, such as generating a list of common interview questions for software engineers or a list of resources to help the student prepare for the interview. It will select a question and ask it.\n",
    "* Memory: some follow-up questions might be asked to help better understand the knowledge of the chosen topic. Memory implementation will allow the chain to keep the context of the conversation.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Agents and Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents and tools are two important concepts in LangChain.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"../images/langchain-agents-tools.webp\" width=\"700px\" /></center>\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents are reusable components that can perform specific tasks such as text generation, language translation, and question-answering. Tools are function libraries that can be used to aid in developing various agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* NewsGenerator agent — for generating news articles or headlines.\n",
    "* DataManipulator tool — for manipulating data (cleaning, transforming, or extracting features).\n",
    "* Application. Building a Q&A system.\n",
    "* Colab and Github links.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s build a Q&A system to answer our questions regarding official holidays in the United Arab Emirates. Based on the components we’ve learned, we can draw a schema similar to the following one below:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we install all dependencies. Some of the versions might be updated, but installing a specific version will resolve most, if not all, inner dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application. Explaining LangChain by Building a Q&A system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s build a Q&A system to answer our questions regarding official holidays in the United Arab Emirates. Based on the components we’ve learned, we can draw a schema similar to the following one below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"../images/langchain-q-and-a.webp\" width=\"700px\" /></center>\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that all dependencies are provided on the Docker image via [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) and [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml). Some of the versions might be updated, but installing a specific version will resolve most, if not all, inner dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question & Answer (Q&A) using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "The most popular techniques using large language models and LangChain are vector similarity search and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for Q&A models: indexing documents using a technique called _vector search_ and then retrieving parts of them relevant to a question, adding these document segments before the question's in a request, and submitting it to an LLM like [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction). **Talk is cheap**. We're going to start out by building a RAG engine using [ChromaDB](https://www.trychroma.com/) which is easy to get started with.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Because the simple, local version of Chroma can be more difficult to scale, we will be using OpenSearch via Docker to work with larger sets of documents."

This hasledtoawhole range (quite likely hundreds) ofsoftware toolboxes or\\none-off programs fordetecting network motifs [18]. This paper outlines briefly theorigins and\\nhistory ofnetwork motifs and themain algorithm foridentifying motifs, that is,before its\\nrecent “rediscovery” [19] (Merton 1961) attheturn ofthemillennia byMilo and colleagues\\n(2002) [1]and Shen-Orr and colleagues (2002) [3].\\nInorder toproceed, wedefine afewbasic terms from network theory. Any network or\\ngraph may bestudied interms ofitsbinary adjacency matrixA.Foranetwork withnnodes,\\nand ann×nbinary adjacency matrixA,thenAij=1implies that node-i isconnected tonode-\\nj,andAij=0otherwise. The network isundirected ifAij=Aji,butingeneral, wedeal with\\ndirected networks inwhich thisequality usually doesn’t hold. The row and column sums ofA\\naregiven byri¼Pn\\nj¼1Aij,andcj¼Pn\\ni¼1Aij,and represent thein-and out-degrees ofall\\nnodes inthenetwork. Akeygoal istofind away togenerate independent random samples\\nfrom thefull“universe” ofallpossible binary adjacency matrices that have thesame row and\\ncolumn sumsr=(ri),c=(cj),respectively. This universe ofmatrices isreferred toasU(r,c) and\\nconstitutes theuniverse ofallpossible matrices having thesame row and column constraints,\\nthus preserving animportant topological feature oftheobserved adjacency matrixA.\\nInecological applications, letussuppose foragiven adjacency matrixAthat rows represent\\nspecies and columns represents islands. ThenAij=1implies that species-i inhabits island-j.\\nThe random matrix ensemble should lock-in characteristics that reflect theability ofsome spe-\\nciestocolonize islands better than other species aswell asthefeature that some islands hold\\nmore species than others. Forthisreason, wegenerate areference ensemble ofrandom matri-\\ncesforournull-model inwhich therow sums (reflecting species colonization abilities) and col-\\numn sums (reflecting island species numbers) never change [20].\\nToourknowledge, thefirst rigorous methods fordetecting nonrandom patterns inadja-\\ncency matrices ornetworks, when compared totheuniverseU(r,c) ofallpossible matrices, can\\nbetraced totheworks ofConnor and Simberloff (1979) [20], Stone (1988) [21], and Stone and\\nRoberts (1992) [5].These studies usetheso-called switch method togenerate anensemble of\\nrandom matrices. The method randomly switches orinterchanges checkerboard configura-\\ntions, asshown inFig2,and rests ontheobservation that applying asingle such switch leaves\\ntherow and column sums ofthematrix unchanged. Applying enough switches randomizes\\ntheadjacency matrix, butwith each switch therow and column sums ofthematrix remain pre-\\nserved. The latter aregenerally fixed tothevalues oftheobserved matrix being tested. Simberl-\\noff(1986) [22] and Stone (1988) [21] attempted toshow computationally that theswitch\\nmethod randomly samples theuniverse ofallpossible matrices fromU(r,c) inamanner that is\\napproximately uniform and discussed schemes fordrawing samples after everyksuccessive\\ninterchanges. Zaman and Simberloff (2002) [23] and Artzy-Randrup and Stone (2005) [24]\\nshow rigorously, using different methods, that exact uniformity canbeachieved with easily\\nimplemented weighting schemes. Independent matrix samples sogenerated from theensem-\\nbleU(r,c) provide areference frame that canbeused toestimate motif frequencies that should\\nbeexpected with arandom model. Other novel sampling methods have since been devised\\n[25,26].\\nAmethod specifically forfinding anover-represented “network motif” was, toourknowl-\\nedge, first outlined explicitly inStone (1988) [21] and Stone and Roberts (1992) [5].They\\ndefined theCscore astheaverage number ofcheckerboard units ormotifs between atypical\\npair ofnodes orspecies.

      "Human: What is a simple network motif?\n",
      "Assistant: A simple network motif is a small pattern of interconnections or subgraphs that appears in a network significantly more often than in randomized networks. It is considered a building block for complex networks and can provide insights into the underlying structure and dynamics of the network. Examples of simple network motifs include feedforward loops, triangular motifs, open bidirectional wedges, and two-hop paths.\n",
      "Human: What is a graphlet? What are orbits?\n",
      "Assistant: Graphlets are small connected subgraphs that can be used to characterize the structure of a network. They provide a way to capture local patterns within a network and have been used in various network analysis tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Orbits, on the other hand, represent the roles of nodes within a subgraph. Each node in a graphlet is assigned to a specific orbit based on its connectivity pattern within the subgraph. Orbits encode information about the local structure around a node and can be used to capture the functional roles of nodes in a network. By tracking the transitions of nodes between different orbits over time, one can gain insights into how the network evolves and changes.\n",

By identifying and analyzing patterns of interconnections, or subgraphs, that occur significantly more often than in randomized networks, network motifs provide insights into the organization and dynamics of complex systems. They can help uncover fundamental principles of network architecture, understand system-wide dynamics, and inform the design and optimization of various network-based applications in fields such as biology, ecology, sociology, epidemiology, finance, and information technology.'"
